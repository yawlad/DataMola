## Templates for task manager
* Main templates are located in "./Main/" - folder, extra in "./Extra/" - folder
* After checking the first task, I decided to redo the mockups in accordance with the comments, so the layouts is not quite similar to the original mockups
* Perhaps the color palette, some animations and structure will change in process, especially when JS will be resolved
* SignIn/SignUp are also ready, but they are not required in this hometask (that is why they are not in the project, but are in the CSS-file)
* 7 .html-files describe the various states of the application
* While creating cards from avia-sales, there were several moments in which it was impossible to implement animations without JS, but I tried to do everything to make them look as similar as possible.
